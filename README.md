js_clock is a simple app using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. This was day #2 of the [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/?fbclid=IwAR2PNkS8QEB92knFU4_0qiVttc_xaRSsey6qCnBZk6Rx7hAvW9_3UYa41ng) Challenge by Wes Bos.

What this app does it takes the current time from JavaScript and updates the clock arms to display the current time. As you can see from the demo this is an analog clock with the standard hour, minute and second hands. Just to mimic a real analog clock the second hand even "bounces". Pretty cool!
